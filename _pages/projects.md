## 2020

### ANIMAL BRAIN - Animal Behavior and Control through RL

> TECHEVIENCE \| IITG.ai \| Mar 2020

- Animal Behavior and Control through Reinforcement Learning  by using techniques such as PPO and Behavior Cloning to make the agent to solve simple common-sense reasoning tasks (Eg: food retrieval,spatial reasoning etc)
- [Github](https://github.com/addy369/AnimalAI)

### FAKE NEWS DETECTION - Fighting against fake news

> TECHEVIENCE \| IITG.ai \| Jan - Mar 2020

- Fake News Detection by using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and BiLSTM attentions and fine tuning on LIAR-PLUS and custom datasets made from Media Charts and Politifact for identifying and analyzing patterns in fake news articles.

## 2019

### RAMAN - The Humanoid

> 4i labs \| IITG \| Sep 2019 - Present

- Project Raman is an android robot that has an appearance resembling an adult human.Raman interact with humans(speech-to-speech) while keeping the eye-to-eye contact with the user.At present I am working on 3D-object detection from RGB-D data. To make hands capable of holding,throwing,catching objects.

### EnWSN - Energy Management in Wireless Sensor Networks

> KRITI \| IITG.ai \| Oct 2019

- A unsupervised model for managing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks using Partly Informed Autoencoder(PISAE). The aim of this project is reduce energy consumption by reducing the number of sensors used with out the loss of data in Cellular Towers.

### LEAFSNAP

>  KRITI \| Coding Club \| Oct 2019

- Plant species identification from theirleaves; specifically all 185 types of trees in the United States, with an accuracy of 89% (Top1).Developed this model so that it is capable ofrunning on compute-constrained devices
- [Github](https://github.com/abhilashreddys/Deep-Leafsnap)

### RUBIK's CUBE SOLVING BOT

> TECHEVIENCE \| Robotics Club \| Feb 2019 - Mar 2019

- A Rubik’s cube solving bot using OpenCV,Kociemba Algorithm, Arduino .Implementing such algorithms on an FPGA. The FPGA interfaces with webcam to sequentially observe each tile of the Rubik’s Cube in a scrambled state.
- [Github](https://github.com/kousikr26/cube-solver)

## Achievements

- Energy Management in WSN stood first in AI for India module in the annual college technical competition (Kriti) 2019, IIT Guwahati.
- Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) an annual research scholarship funded by Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India (2017)
