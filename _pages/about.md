## Bio

- I am an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning enthusiast pursuing my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at IIT Guwahati. I am proficient at Python Programming (skilled at Tensorflow, Keras, ROS, sci-kit learn), C and C++.
I love to keep myself abreast of the latest research in artificial intelligence. I am constantly aspiring to learn more from novel projects and am also a Core Team Member at the IITG.ai community, where we regularly discuss/implement the most groundbreaking and significant research papers especially in the area of deep learning.
